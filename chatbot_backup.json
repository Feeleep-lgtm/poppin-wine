The House Select Committee on Assassinations concluded that President Kennedy was struck by two shots fired from behind, but there are differing theories about where those shots came from. Some argue that a bullet fired from the grassy knoll in front of the moving limousine was responsible for entering the front of Kennedy's head. The Warren Commission, the Ramsey Clark team, and the Rockefeller Commission all concluded that the President was struck by two bullets from behind, but doubts still remain about the exact nature and location of the President's wounds.\n\nSources:\n- https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/part-1a.html\n- https://www.jfklibrary.org/learn/about-jfk/jfk-in-history/november-22-1963-death-of-the-president\n- https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/part-1a.html",

The paper outlines a three-pass method for reading papers, designed to help readers extract the most important information without getting bogged down in unnecessary details.  Three-Pass Method: First Pass (Quick Overview):  The first pass is a quick skim of the paper to get a general idea of its content and structure. This includes reading the title, abstract, introduction, section headings, and conclusion. The goal is to determine the paper’s relevance to your work and decide whether it is worth a deeper read. Second Pass (Understanding Content):  The second pass involves reading the paper in more detail but still without getting into the finer details like proofs or deep technicalities. This includes looking at the figures, diagrams, and important equations. The reader should be able to grasp the paper's main arguments and methodology, identifying any unfamiliar references or concepts that may need further review. Third Pass (In-depth Understanding):  The third pass is a thorough reading of the entire paper, focusing on understanding the paper in detail. At this stage, you would critically evaluate the assumptions, methodology, and results, as well as relate the paper to other work in the field. This pass is typically only for papers that are highly relevant to your work. Additional Tips: Take Notes: Keshav advises taking structured notes during the reading process to help with comprehension and retention. Ask Questions: During each pass, it's important to ask critical questions to assess the quality and contribution of the paper. Background Research: If the paper references concepts or works that are unfamiliar, Keshav recommends doing background research to fill in any knowledge gaps. The paper emphasizes the importance of efficiency in reading academic literature and provides a systematic approach that can save time while ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the material.",
